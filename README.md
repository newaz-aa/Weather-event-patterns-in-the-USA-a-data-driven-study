## Objective 
The aim of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of various weather events that occurred across the United States between 2011 and 2018. The project will focus on identifying patterns, trends, and the impact of weather events such as floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and tornadoes. By leveraging data science techniques, this analysis will provide insights into the frequency, distribution, and severity of these events over the given period.

## Data
The dataset contains detailed records of weather events, including event type, date, location, fatalities, injuries, property damage, etc.

Each year data contains over 60,000 records. 8 years's data - so, in total around half a million records. 

## Synopsis
* The data requires extensive preprocessing before it can be used for analysis.
* Find the answer to some key questions like -
  1.  Which states had the highest occurrence of events?
  2.  Most frequent weather events in different states.
  3.  Which events caused the highest number of deaths? Particular events can be observed such as debris flows in the coastal community of Montecito in Santa Barbara County, California, which caused more than 20 deaths.
  4.  Which events caused the greatest damage to property?
  5.  Explore the locations and times of different events
* Visualize the frequency and distribution of different types of weather events across regions and years.
* Analyze the seasonal patterns of specific weather events. 
* Study changes in weather patterns over time to identify any shifts in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.
* Identify weather-prone areas and their vulnerability to specific types of weather events (e.g., tornado, hurricane zones).
* Use machine learning models to predict the likelihood of certain weather events based on historical data and regional factors.
* Assess the economic and social impact of weather events by analyzing trends in property damage, fatalities, and injuries.

## Potential Applications
* Disaster management
* Risk assessment for insurance companies
* Government policy recommendations
